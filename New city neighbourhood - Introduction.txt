What if you secured a great new job in another city but you have come to love your current neighbourhood? Would moving to a similar neighbourhood in the new city make your decision easier? But what if you are not familiar with the new city and have no idea what neighbourhoods are similar to where you live now?
We live in a time where the workforce is increasingly mobile, not only within countries but also internationally. Moving to an unfamiliar city has many challenges, with finding the best place to live high on that list. A tool that makes this search easier will help users to settle into their new city quicker, rather than spend valuable weekends trudging from one neighbourhood to another to look for a pace to live. 
Is there a way to narrow down the neighbourhoods to explore? If so, what criteria should be used to compare neighbourhoods? 
Average income, average education, average household size, average age, average cost of accommodation? All these might be relevant, but it could be argued that one of the main reasons people grow to love their neighbourhoods is because of the services that the neighbourhood gives one access to: the parks, the coffee shops, the gyms, the bars and restaurants, etc.
The purpose of this project is to take as an input a userâ€™s current address and then suggest similar neighbourhoods in a target city. These suggestions could then serve as a starting point to narrow down a preferred location based on additional criteria such as affordability and commute time.
